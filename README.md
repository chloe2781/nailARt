# nailARt
An iOS app to visualize and design nails using AR
====================

An app that leverages augmented reality technology to provide a more accurate and convenient way of selecting nail designs.
This app will allow users to preview different designs on their own hands in real-time through the use of their phone camera.

## Why does it matter?

The problem that this app aims to solve is the difficulty in choosing and visualizing nail designs. Many people struggle to imagine how a particular design would look on their nails, making the selection process challenging by having to spend so much time and money on finding and doing nail sets that came out very different than expectations. With this app, users can eliminate the guesswork and make more informed decisions by seeing the designs on their own hands in real-time.

## Benefits?

The app will benefit the target audience by making the process of choosing nail designs easier and more enjoyable. It saves time and eliminates the need for physical try-ons, making it more convenient and sustainable for users (a nail set that lasts for 3-4 weeks could cost ~ $50-$500). By providing a real-time preview, users can adjust or choose different designs with ease, leading to a more satisfying experience in selecting and visualizing nail designs. This is made to save time, money, and effort.

## About

I'm Chloe and I do nails for fun now (used to be professionally). As I spend so much time doing and designing nails, it's very often to hate the vision that I have for a set of nails after it's done. Similarly, my friends and customers felt the same way after they have their set done because so many things could go wrong (same shape different length look differently on different hands, just to start with). I needed a solution to be more sustainable to pursue my love for nail art, and here it is, NailARt (get it cuz AR in art :) )


And I'm Liz, the mega-coder to Chloe's super-coder. I hopped on this project at the start of 2024 to help Chloe develop this app because I believed (and still do) that nailARt could fill this niche and blend all existing nail apps together to make the best experience for nail technicians and customers alike (but I also just love working together with Chloe). I love art and design, and I breathe code, so nailARt was perfect for me. We hope it's perfect for you too <3.
